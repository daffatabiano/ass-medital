Weather Search Page
Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for developing a single-page web application that allows users to search for weather information for a specific location and displays the results using the OpenWeather API. The application is designed with a focus on user experience and visual appeal.

Functional Requirements
2.1 Search Functionality
The page features a prominent search bar where users can enter the name of a city or location.
The search is triggered either by pressing the “Enter” key or clicking a dedicated search button.
The application handles invalid or empty search inputs gracefully, providing appropriate feedback to the user.
2.2 Weather Data Display
Upon a successful search, the application retrieves weather data from the OpenWeather API for the specified location.
The displayed weather information includes:
Current temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit)
Weather condition (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy)
Humidity
Wind speed
An icon representing the weather condition
The data is presented in a clear, visually appealing format. Consider using cards, tables, or other UI elements to organize the information.
2.3 Error Handling
The application gracefully handles errors that may occur during the API call (e.g., invalid API key, location not found).
Error messages are informative and user-friendly.
API Integration
The application utilizes the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data.
An API key is required (obtainable from OpenWeather).
The API calls are made using appropriate HTTP methods (e.g., GET).
The application handles different response codes from the API and displays appropriate messages to the user.
Creative Design Elements
The design should be as creative and appealing as possible.
Technical Requirements
The application can be developed using any suitable front-end framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) or with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The code should be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain.
Testing
Thorough testing should be conducted to ensure the application functions correctly and handles different scenarios (valid/invalid inputs, API errors, etc.).
Development Environment Setup and Running the Application
7.1 Zero-Environment Approach
The application should be runnable without requiring users to have a pre-configured development environment.
Provide clear and step-by-step instructions on how to set up the necessary environment from a completely clean slate. This might include:
Installing Node.js and npm (or yarn)
Installing any project-specific dependencies using a package manager (npm or yarn)
Instructions on running a development server (if applicable)
7.2 Detailed Setup Instructions
Include a dedicated section in the documentation that outlines the entire process, from installing basic tools to running the application locally.
Break down the instructions into small, manageable steps with clear explanations.
Include screenshots or screen recordings (if possible) to aid visual learners.
Consider different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and provide platform-specific instructions where needed.
7.3 Example
For a React application, the instructions might look like this (simplified):

Install Node.js and npm: Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm.
Navigate to Project Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.
Install Dependencies: Run the command npm install to install all the project’s dependencies listed in the package.json file.
Start Development Server: Run the command npm start. This will start a local development server and open the application in your default web browser.
